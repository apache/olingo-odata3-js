// ObservableHttpClient.js
// This object extends OData's default httpClient by supporting request and response recording sessions, and firing a custom
// JQuery event for each request/response.
//
// The events fired by this object are:
//      request: Before a request is made
//      success: Before the primary success handler is called
//
// To bind to an event, JQuery event attachers can be used on the object, e.g.
//      $(observableHttpClient).bind("request", function (request) { ... });
//
// To begin a new recording session, use:
//      var session = observableHttpClient.newSession();
//
// Requests and responses are then recorded in session.requests and session.responses. Session can be ended by session.end().
// Multiple simultaneous sessions are supported.
